This is a Rust script for solving Aristotle's puzzle, an infamously difficult combinatorics problem. Although there is only 1 actual solution, this code finds 12 coresponding to rotations
and reflections of the hexagonal grid. The run time seems to be 3.4s on average, though I have not written a proper benchmark.
